.Abstract

This documentation is intended for users who will be performing front line
processes in the acquisitions module. Documented functions include creating
selection lists, creating and activating purchase orders, and receiving,
invoicing, and claiming items. Administrative functions are documented in
Administration Functions in the Acquisitions Module.  This document is intended
for first time users of the Acquisitions module as well as those who are
familiar with the module and need only a reference guide. The contents of this
document are alphabetized by topic.

Brief Records
-------------

Brief records are short bibliographic records with minimal information that are
often used as placeholder records until items are received. Brief records can
be added to selection lists or purchase orders and can be imported into the
catalog. You can add brief records to new or existing selection lists. You can
add brief records to new, pending or on-order purchase orders.

Add brief records to a selection list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  . Click Acquisitions -> New Brief Record. You can also add brief records to
an existing selection list by clicking the Actions menu on the selection list
and choosing Add Brief Record.
  . Choose a selection list from the drop down menu, or enter the name of a new selection list.
  . Enter bibliographic information in the desired fields.
  . Click Save Record.

Add brief records to purchase orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

record is added to the purchase order that you just created.
  . Click Save Record.

Cancel/suspend acquisitions
---------------------------

You can cancel entire purchase orders, line items on the purchase orders, and individual copies
that are attached to a line item. You can also use cancel reasons to suspend purchase orders,
line items, and copies. For example, a cancel reason such as Delayed Publication, would
indicate that the item will be purchased when the item is published. The purchase is, in effect,
suspended rather than cancelled, but the state of the purchase order, line item, or copy would
still become cancelled.

Cancel/suspend copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can cancel or suspend line items that are in a state of on order or pending order.

  . Select the Copies link.
  . Click the Cancel link adjacent to the copy that you wish to cancel.
  . Select a cancel reason from the drop down menu that appears, and click Cancel copy.

and click Cancel Line Items. The status of the line item is now cancelled.

Cancel/suspend purchase orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  . Notice the Cancel column in the top half of the purchase order.
  . Click the drop down arrow adjacent to Cancel order, and select a reason for
cancelling the order.
  . Click Cancel order. The state of the purchase order is cancelled.

Claim items
-----------

Manual claiming of items can be accomplished in multiple ways, but electronic
claiming is not available in the 2.0 release.

You can apply claim policies to line items or individual copies. You also can
use the default claim policy associated with your provider to claim items.

Apply a claim policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply a claim policy to an item in one of two ways: apply a claim
policy to a line item when the item is created on the selection list or
purchase order, or use the default claim policy associated with the provider on
the purchase order. The default claim policy for a provider is established when
the provider is created and will be used for claiming if no claim policy has
been applied.

  . Open a selection list or purchase order. See section 13 for more information.
  . Click the Actions drop down menu on the line item.
  . Click Apply Claim Policy.
  . A drop down menu of claim policies will appear. Choose a claim policy to
apply to the line item. The claim policy will be applied to all items that have
not been received or cancelled.
  . Click Save.

you will take. You can claim items that have not been received or cancelled.
  . Click Claim Selected.
  . Select a claim type from the drop down menu. Entering a note is optional.
  . Click Claim.
  . The number of existing claims on the line item updates, and a claim voucher
appears. The voucher can be printed and mailed to the vendor to initiate the
claim.

Produce a list of claim-ready items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an item has not been received and meets the conditions for claiming
according to the itemâ€™s claim policy, then the item will be eligible for
claiming. Evergreen can produce a list of items, by ordering branch, which is
ready to be claimed. You can use this list to manually claim items from your
provider.

  . Click Acquisitions ->Claim-Ready Items.

a spreadsheet.

Funds
-----

You can apply a single fund or multiple funds to copies on a selection list or
purchase order.  You can change the fund that has been applied to an item at
any time on a selection list. You can change the fund that has been applied to
an item on a purchase order if the purchase order has not yet been activated.

Funds can be applied to items from the Copies link that is located on a line
item. Funds can also be applied to copies by batch updating line items and
their attendant copies.

You can create invoices for purchase orders, individual line items, and blanket
purchases. You can also link existing invoices to purchase orders. In 2.0, all
invoicing is manual.

You can invoice items before you receive the items if desired. You can also
reopen closed invoices, and you can print all invoices.

Create a blanket invoice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a blanket invoice for purchases that are not attached to a

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create an invoice for all of the line items on a purchase order. The
only fields that are required to save the invoice are the Vendor Invoice ID and
the number of items invoiced, billed, and paid for each line item. With the
exception of fields with drop down menus, no limitations on the data that you
enter exist.

  . Open a purchase order.
  . Click Create Invoice.
  . Enter a Vendor Invoice ID. This number may be listed on the paper invoice sent from your
vendor.
  . Choose a Receive Method from the drop down menu.

  . Enter a Payment Authorization.
  . The Receiver defaults to the branch at which your workstation is registered. You can
change the receiver by selecting an org unit from the drop down menu.
The bibliographic line items are listed in the next section of the invoice. Along with the title
and author of the line items is a summary of copies ordered, received, invoiced, claimed, and
cancelled. You can also view the amounts estimated, encumbered, and paid for each line item.
Finally, each line item has a line item ID and links to the selection list (if used) and the purchase
order.
  . Enter the number of items that were invoiced, the amount that the organization was billed,
and the amount that the organization paid.
  . You have the option to add charge types if applicable. Charge types are additional charges
that can be selected from the drop down menu. Common charge types include taxes and
handling fees.
  . You have three options for saving an invoice. You can click Save, which saves the changes
that you have made, but keeps the invoice open. You can click Save and Prorate, which
enables you to save the invoice and prorate any additional charges, such as taxes, across
funds, if multiple funds have been used to pay the invoice. You also can click Save and
Close. Choose this option when you have completed the invoice.
[NOTE]
You can re-open a closed invoice by clicking the link, Re-open invoice. This link
appears at the bottom of a closed invoice.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the link invoice feature to link an existing invoice to a purchase
order. For example, an invoice is received for a shipment with items on
purchase order #1 and purchase order #2.  When the invoice arrives, purchase

on a purchase order; view invoices by searching specific invoice fields; view
invoices attached to a line item.

  * To view open invoices, click Acquisitions -> Open invoices. This opens the Acquisitions
Search screen. The default fields search for open invoices. Click Search.
  * To view invoices on a purchase order, open a purchase order, and click the View Invoices
link. The number in parentheses indicates the number of invoices that are attached to the
purchase order.

  *  To view invoices for a line item, see section 7.5.10.

Line Items
----------

Line items represent bibliographic records on a selection list or purchase
order. One line item corresponds to one bibliographic record. Line items
contain attributes, which are characteristics of the bibliographic record, such
as ISBNs or Title. Line items also contain copy information, price information,
and notes and alerts.

Add alerts to a line item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts are pop up messages that appear when an item is received. Alerts can be
printed on the line item worksheet.

  . Click the Notes link on the line item.
  . Click the New Alert drop down button.
  . Choose an alert code from the drop down menu.
  . Add additional comments if desired.
  . Click Create. The alert will display on the screen.

to line items on a selection list or a purchase order.

  . Click the Copies link on a line item.
  . Enter the number of items that you want to order in Item Count, and click Go. The number
of items that you want to order will display below.
  . If desired, apply a Distribution Formula from the drop down list. Distribution formulas tell
the ILS how many copies should be distributed to each location.
  . The owning branch and shelving location populate with entries from the distribution
formula. Click Apply.
  . Look back at the top gray row of text boxes above the distribution formula. Each text box in
this row corresponds to the columns below. Changes made here will be applied to all
copies below. Click Batch Update.
  . Click Save Changes.
  . Click Return to return to the selection list or purchase order.
  . Add the itemâ€™s price to the line item in the Estimated Price field.

Add notes to a line item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notes on line items can include any additional information that you want to add
to the line item. Notes can be internal or can be made available to providers.
Notes appear in a pop up box when an item is received. Notes can be printed on
line item worksheets, which can be printed and placed in books for processing.

  . Click the Notes link on the line item.
  . Click the New Note drop down button.

Line Item Worksheet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Line Item Worksheet was designed to be a printable sheet that contains
details about the line item, including alerts and notes, and distribution of
the copies. This worksheet could placed in a book that is sent to cataloging or
processing.

  . From a selection list or purchase order, click the worksheet link on the line item.
  . The line item worksheet appears.
  . To print the worksheet, click the Print Page link in the top right corner.

Link line items to the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can link a MARC record or brief record on a selection list to the corresponding MARC record
in the catalog. This may be useful for librarians who have a brief MARC record in their catalog
and want to import a better record that is attached to their selection list. No collision detection
exists when importing an item into the selection list or catalog, so the link to catalog option
enables you to search for a matching record and link to it from the selection list or purchase
order. When you import the record from the purchase order, the record will overlay the linked
record in the catalog.

  . From the line item, click Link to catalog.
  . In the text box that pops up, search terms, such as ISBN and title, are entered by default.
  . Click Search.
  . Result(s) appear. Click the link to View MARC, or Select the record to link it to the record on
the selection list or purchase order.
  . The screen will reload, and the line item displays with a catalog link. The records are linked.

Load Bib Records and Items Into the Catalog
-------------------------------------------

You can load bib records and items into the catalog at three different locations in the
acquisitions module.

  * You can import bib records and items (if holdings information is attached) when you upload
MARC order records. Click Acquisitions -> Load MARC Order Records and check the box
adjacent to Load Bibs and Items into the ILS.
  * You can import bib records and items into the catalog when you create a purchase order
from a selection list. From the selection list, click Actions -> Create Purchase Order. Check
the box adjacent to Load Bibs and Items into the ILS to import the records into the catalog.
  * You can import bib records and items into the catalog from a purchase order by clicking
Actions -> Load Bibs and Items.
[NOTE]
If you have not loaded bib records and items into the catalog before you activate
a purchase order, then the ILS will automatically import the bib records and
items into the catalog when you activate the purchase order.

Load Catalog Record IDs
-----------------------

The Load Catalog Record IDs function enables you to create line items from a
list of catalog records whose record IDs are saved in a CSV file.

This would be useful if you want to batch order copies of items that your
organization already owns. For example, you run a copy/hold ratio report to
identify how many copies you have available compared to the number of holds
that are on your Hot Fiction display. You decide that you want to order an
extra copy of six titles. Your copy/hold ratio report includes the record ID of
each title. You can save the record IDs into a CSV file, upload the file into
the ILS, and create a purchase order for the items.

  . Create a CSV file with the record ID of each catalog record in the first
column of the spreadsheet. You can create this CSV file from a spreadsheet
generated by a report, as suggested in the aforementioned example. You can also
copy and paste record IDs from the catalog record into the CSV file.
+
[NOTE]
Record IDs are auto-generated digits associated with each record. They are
found in the Record Summary that appears at the top of each record.
+
  . Save the CSV file to your computer.
  . Click Acquisitions -> Load Catalog Record IDs.
  . Click Load More Terms.
  . The screen will display the number of terms (record IDs) that have been loaded.
  . Click Retrieve Records. The records will appear as line items to which you can add copies,
notes, and pricing information. Use the Actions menu to save these items to a selection list or
purchase order.

Load MARC Order Records
-----------------------

The Load MARC Order Records screen enables you to upload MARC records that have been
saved on your computer into the ILS. You can add the records to a selection list and/or to a
purchase order. You can both create and activate purchase orders in one step from this
interface. Also, from this interface, you can load bibs and items into the catalog.

  . Click Acquisitions -> Load MARC Order Records
  . If you want to upload the MARC records to a new purchase order, then click the check box
adjacent to Create Purchase Order.
  . If you want to activate the purchase order at the time of creation, then click the check box
adjacent to Activate Purchase Order.
  . If you want to load bibs and items into the catalog, then click the check box adjacent to
Load Bibs and Items into the ILS.
  . Enter the name of the Provider. The text will auto-complete.
  . Select an org unit from the drop down menu. The context org unit is the org unit that
"owns" the bib record. You should select a physical location rather than a political or
administrative org unit as the context org unit. For example, the Smith County Library
System is funding purchase of a copy of Gone with the Wind. The system owns the bib
record, but it cannot receive the physical item. The acquisitions librarian will choose a
physical branch of that system, a processing center or an individual branch, to receive the
item.
  . If you want to upload the records to a selection list, you can select a list from the drop down
menu, or type in the name of the selection list that you want to create.
  . Click Browse to search for the file of bibliographic records.
  . Click Upload.
  . A summary of the items that have been processed will appear.
  . Click the links that appear to view the purchase order or the selection list.

MARC Federated Search
---------------------

The MARC Federated Search enables you to import bibliographic records into a selection list or
purchase order from a Z39.50 source.

  . Click Acquisitions -> MARC Federated Search.
  . Check the boxes of Z39.50 services that you want to search. Your local Evergreen Catalog is
checked by default. Click Submit.
  . A list of results will appear. Click the Copies link to add copy information to the line item.
See section 7 for more information.
  . Click the Notes link to add notes or line item alerts to the line item. See section 7 for more
information.
  . Enter a price in the Estimated Price field.
  . You can save the line item(s) to a selection list by checking the box on the line item and
clicking Actions ->Save Items to Selection List. You can also create a purchase order from
the line item(s) by checking the box on the line item and clicking Actions -> Create
Purchase Order.

Patron Requests
---------------

The patron requests interface will allow you to view requests that patrons make
via the OPAC.  The functionality for OPAC requests is not currently available
in the native Evergreen interface, so the screen remains blank in 2.0.

Purchase Orders
---------------

You can create a purchase order from a selection list, a batch upload of MARC
order records, the View/Place Orders link in the catalog, or results from a
MARC Federated Search. For more information on creating purchase orders using
these methods, see sections 16, 10, 17, and 11.  You can also create blanket
purchase orders to which you can add brief records or generic charges and fees.

Activate a purchase order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can active a purchase order, the following criteria must be met:

  . The field, Activate Order?, is located in the top half of the purchase order. The answer
adjacent to this field must be Yes.
  . Each line item must contain an estimated price. If the Activate Order? field in the top half
of the purchase order reads, No: The lineitem has no price (ACQ_LINEITEM_NO_PRICE),
then simply enter a price in the estimated price field, tab out of the field, and click Reload.

When the above criteria have been met, proceed with the following:
  . Look at the Activate Order? field in the top half of the purchase order. Click the
hyperlinked Activate Order. When you activate the order, the bibliographic records and
copies will be imported into the catalog, and the funds associated with the purchases will be
encumbered.

record.
[NOTE]
The Total Estimated is the sum of the prices. The Total Encumbered is the total
estimated that is encumbered when the purchase order is activated. The Total
Spent column automatically updates when the items are invoiced.

Mark ready for order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After an item has been added to a selection list or purchase order, you can mark it ready for
order. This step is optional but may be useful to individual workflows.

  . If you want to mark part of a selection list ready for selector, then you can check the box(es)
of the line item(s) that you wish to mark ready for selector. If you want to mark the entire

Selection Lists. Use the general search to view selection lists created by

catalog (section 17). See the sections listed in parentheses for more
information on each of these methods.
